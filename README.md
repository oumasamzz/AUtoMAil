This project demonstrates an automated email response system using Python, integrating with Gmail's IMAP and SMTP servers, and leveraging ChatGPT from OpenAI. The script continuously monitors the inbox, processes incoming emails, extracts relevant information, and generates contextually appropriate replies using ChatGPT.Let's break down each step of the code and explain it in simple terms.

Step 1: Import necessary libraries

   We start by importing libraries we'll use throughout the script.

Step 2: Define a function to send an email

  We define a function send_email to send an email using Gmail's SMTP server.

Step 3: Define a function to fetch unread emails

  We define a function fetch_emails to connect to Gmail's IMAP server and fetch unread emails.

Step 4: Define a function to process emails

  We define a function process_emails to fetch unread emails and process each of them.

Step 5: Define a function to reply to an email

  We define a function reply_to_email to reply to the sender of an email.

Step 6: Define a function to extract the body of an email

  We define a function extract_body to extract the text body of an email.

Step 7: Define a function to compose a reply using ChatGPT

  We define a function compose_reply to generate a reply to the email body using ChatGPT.

Step 8: Define the main loop

  We create a main loop that continuously checks for new emails and processes them.

By following each step, you'll understand how the script works to automatically reply to incoming emails using ChatGPT. Make sure to replace placeholders like 'your_email@gmail.com' and 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual Gmail credentials and ChatGPT API key.
